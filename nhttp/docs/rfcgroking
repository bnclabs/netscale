Main specifications:
====================

2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1.
    R. Fielding, J. Gettys, J. Mogul, H. Frystyk, L. Masinter, P. Leach,
        T. Berners-Lee.
    June 1999.
    (Format: TXT=422317, PS=5529857, PDF=550558 bytes)
    (Obsoletes RFC2068)
    (Updated by RFC2817, RFC5785, RFC6266, RFC6585)
    (Status: DRAFT STANDARD)

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol
    for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a
    generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its
    use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management
    systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and
    headers. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data
    representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data
    being transferred.

    HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative
    since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as
    "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068.

    An errata to RFC2616 is available, it collects also errata to RFC2617

2617 HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication.
    J.  Franks, P. Hallam-Baker, J. Hostetler, S. Lawrence, P. Leach,
        A.  Luotonen, L. Stewart.
    June 1999.
    (Format: TXT=77638 bytes)
    (Obsoletes RFC2069)
    (Status: DRAFT STANDARD)

    "HTTP/1.0", includes the specification for a Basic Access Authentication
    scheme. This scheme is not considered to be a secure method of user
    authentication (unless used in conjunction with some external secure
    system such as SSL [5]), as the user name and password are passed over
    the network as cleartext.

    This document also provides the specification for HTTP's authentication
    framework, the original Basic authentication scheme and a scheme based on
    cryptographic hashes, referred to as "Digest Access Authentication". It is
    therefore also intended to serve as a replacement for RFC 2069 [6]. Some
    optional elements specified by RFC 2069 have been removed from this
    specification due to problems found since its publication; other new
    elements have been added for compatibility, those new elements have been
    made optional, but are strongly recommended.

    Like Basic, Digest access authentication verifies that both parties to a
    communication know a shared secret (a password); unlike Basic, this
    verification can be done without sending the password in the clear, which
    is Basic's biggest weakness. As with most other authentication protocols,
    the greatest sources of risks are usually found not in the core protocol
    itself but in policies and procedures surrounding its use.

2145 Use and Interpretation of HTTP Version Numbers.
    J. C. Mogul, R.  Fielding, J. Gettys, H. Frystyk.
    May 1997.
    (Format: TXT=13659 bytes)
    (Status: INFORMATIONAL)

    HTTP request and response messages include an HTTP protocol version
    number. Some confusion exists concerning the proper use and interpretation
    of HTTP version numbers, and concerning interoperability of HTTP
    implementations of different protocol versions. This document is an
    attempt to clarify the situation.

2109 HTTP State Management Mechanism. D. Kristol, L. Montulli.
     February 1997. (Format: TXT=43469 bytes) (Obsoleted by RFC2965)
     (Status: HISTORIC)

    This document specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP
    requests and responses. It describes two new headers, Cookie and
    Set-Cookie, which carry state information between participating origin
    servers and user agents. The method described here differs from Netscape's
    Cookie proposal, but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that
    use Netscape's method. (See the HISTORICAL section.)

    Although obsoleted HTTP working group seem to stick with it ???

    RFC-6265 HTTP State Management Mechanism.
        A. Barth.
        April 2011.
        (Format: TXT=79724 bytes)
        (Obsoletes RFC2965)
        (Status: PROPOSED STANDARD)

2047 MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Three: Message
     Header Extensions for Non-ASCII Text.
    K. Moore.
    November 1996.
    (Format: TXT=33262 bytes)
    (Obsoletes RFC1521, RFC1522, RFC1590)
    (Updated by RFC2184, RFC2231)
    (Status: DRAFT STANDARD)

    HTTP protocol is based on MIME format. Understanding the philosophy behind
    MIME format will throw some light on how HTTP inter-operates with other
    MIME based protocols like SMTP, NNTP etc ...

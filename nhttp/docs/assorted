inactive_timeout :
    Inactive timeout specifies the number of milli-seconds, the connection
    process should wait for new requests. When this timeout expires, the
    connection will be closed and the process exits. Typical configurations
    are - for high traffic & short user-sessions, it can be configured like
    5 minutes, for low traffic prolonged user-sessions, it can be configured
    like 3-4 hours.

    Note that, connections are not opened in keep-alive mode. So, when a
    client connection is lost (not properly closed), there will be a leakage
    in connected process. By configuring an optimal timeout this leakage can
    be made self-limiting.

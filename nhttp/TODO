- Experiment with {keepalive, true} inet listen option. Like unplugging
  ethernet cable and check the error response on the server side.

- Explore applications for,
    Gopher, SMTP, NNTP, FTP, WAIS

- Interpreting resource identifier from http request:

   An origin server that does differentiate resources based on the host
   requested (sometimes referred to as virtual hosts or vanity host
   names) MUST use the following rules for determining the requested
   resource on an HTTP/1.1 request:

   1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
     ignored.

   2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.

   3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.

- Interpreting host-name from Request-URI and Host header field.

   1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
     ignored.

   2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.

   3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.

- To encode an IRI into a URI, take the path and query parts, UTF-8-encode
  them then percent-encode the non-ASCII bytes:
    http://www.example.com/d%C3%BCsseldorf?neighbourhood=L%C3%B6rick

  If there are non-ASCII characters in the hostname part of the IRI, eg.
  http://例え.テスト/, they have be encoded using Punycode instead.
